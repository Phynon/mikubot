![Nonebot Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/nonebot-1.8.2-blue)

A QQ-bot for Project Sekai: Colorful Stage! featuring Hatsune Miku based on [Nonebot](https://github.com/nonebot/nonebot) framework.

## Introduction

**Mikubot** is based on [Nonebot](https://github.com/nonebot/nonebot) framework and strongly coupled with the demands of a tiny group of players. The project is initially sparked by [ BandoriBot](https://github.com/cc004/BandoriBot) and [HoshinoBot](https://github.com/Ice-Cirno/HoshinoBot), and the functional details are developed inspired by the two QQ-bots mentioned, as well as Project Sekai Profile.

It is not sure whether the project is to be renamed.



## Functions

Mikubot focuses on players of [Project Sekai: Colorful Stage! featuring Hatsune Miku](http://pjsekai.sega.jp), providing a reduced number of funtional modules currently:
- **simple chat**
- **pull event ranking data and predictions**
- **pull personal event ranking data for assigned players**
- **play short records of in-game musics randomly or on demand**
- **gacha simulation**

## Acknowledgements

The main framework of the project is determined at the advice of [**Ice-Cirno "咖啡"**](https://github.com/Ice-Cirno), and the implementaion of HoshinoBot has influenced several modules of this project.

[**cc004**](https://github.com/cc004) provided assistance with the crucial part of the basis of several functional modules.

The project of [**Circle Lin**](https://twitter.com/nilcric) inspired the plan to develop profile query functions.

The two major databases, [**Sekai Viewer**](https://sekai.best) and [**pjsek.ai**](https://pjsek.ai), provided abundant in-game data for this project.

[**Nightwheel**](https://github.com/NachtgeistW), **Koko_McAlawn** and a small group of **fellow players** have provided brilliant ideas about the functions to be developed.
